## What is all this about?
I wnted to keep practicing my React learning, so I decided to write a shopping cart app.

The App was written using React, TypeScript and Tailwind CSS, all configured with Vite. I wanted to practice with a reducer, so most of the logic is written in the product-reducer.ts file.

## Instalation
- Clone this repository and install node modules with the `npm install` command. You'll need to install NodeJS if case you haven't yet.
- If working with Vite, run the script `npm run dev` to run the code in your local machine or want to make your own changes.
- To compile, run `npm run dev` if working with vite

## Disclamer
This is NOT a commercial project and was written just as a studying excercise. All images are intelectual property of its original creators.
